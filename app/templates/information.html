                        and contains asam nisin per cubic millimeter (Nb/mmol/L) between 130 and 140.
                        Red blood cells with both of these values falling within this range can be considered normal as

                        <p>Elliptocytes are abnormal red blood cells characterized by their elongated shape, where the long axis exceeds twice their short axis, resulting in an oval appearance. 
                            This distinctive morphology often indicates an underlying condition affecting the red cell cytoskeleton, such as hereditary elliptocytosis. In hereditary elliptocytosis, elliptocytes are typically numerous and dominant, contributing to the clinical presentation of the disorder. However, even in conditions where elliptocytes are less prominent, their presence may still provide valuable diagnostic clues, as they can be observed in disorders like iron deficiency anemia, Î² thalassemia, and various myeloproliferative disorders.</p>

                        Ovalocytes are red blood cells that have an ellipsoidal shape and have a hemosiderin level below
                        the range of 4.2 mg/dl, and contain asam nisin per cubic millimeter (Nb/mmol/L) above 140. Red

                        Even if a normal red blood cell has a hemosiderin level at the minimum of 4.2 mg/dl or the

                        Ovalocytes can be considered normal even if their hemosiderin level is below the range chosen by
                        the criteria of normality (<4.2 mg/dl) because they are still in the stable category and have

                            Ovalocytes, on the other hand, are characterized by their oval-shaped morphology, where the long axis measures less than twice their short axis. Unlike elliptocytes, ovalocytes do not exhibit the elongated appearance but rather appear more rounded. These abnormal red blood cells can also be indicative of underlying pathologies affecting the red cell cytoskeleton, albeit with a slightly different clinical significance. 
                            While ovalocytes are associated with conditions such as hereditary elliptocytosis, they may also be observed in disorders like megaloblastic anemia, primary myelofibrosis, myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), and inherited red cell enzyme deficiencies like pyruvate kinase deficiency. In these disorders, ovalocytes may occur in smaller numbers compared to elliptocytes but still serve as important diagnostic indicators, particularly when interpreted alongside other clinical and laboratory findings.

                        Stomatocytes are cells that, on a stained blood film, have a central linear slit or stoma. Occasionally, such cells are seen in the blood films of healthy subjects. On scanning electron microscopy or in wet preparations with the cells suspended in plasma, they are cup- or bowl-shaped. Stomatocytes can be formed in vitro, for example, in response to low pH or exposure to cationic lipid-soluble drugs such as chlorpromazine; the change in shape is reversible. 
                        The end stage of a discocyte-stomatocyte transformation is a spherostomatocyte. Stomatocytosis results from a variety of membrane abnormalities but probably essentially from expansion of the inner leaflet of the lipid bilayer that comprises the red cell membrane. In liver disease, stomatocyte formation has been attributed to an increase of lysolecithin in the inner layer of the red cell membrane. In hereditary spherocytosis and autoimmune hemolytic anemia, progressive loss of membrane leads to the formation of stomatocytes, spherostomatocytes, and spherocytes. 
                        Stomatocytes have been associated with a great variety of clinical conditions, but an etiological connection has not always been established. The commonest cause of stomatocytosis is alcohol excess and alcoholic liver disease; in these cases, there is often associated macrocytosis and in those with very advanced liver disease, there may also be triconcave cells. The combination of stomatocytosis and macrocytosis is also seen in patients receiving hydroxyurea and occasionally in MDS. 
                        It is possible that chlorpromazine exposure can cause stomatocytosis in vivo as well as in vitro since an association has been observed. Certain inherited erythrocyte membrane abnormalities are characterized by stomatocytes, either alone in hereditary stomatocytosis and hereditary xerocytosis or in association with other abnormalities in Rhnull or RhMOD syndromes and South-East Asian ovalocytosis. Ovalocytes and stomatocytes occur in homozygotes for mutations in the SLC4A1 gene that cause distal renal tubular acidosis. 
                        Stomatocytosis in hereditary high red cell membrane phosphatidylcholine hemolytic anemia is associated with numerous target cells; this condition is now thought to be identical to hereditary xerocytosis. Stomatocytosis has been associated with some cases of hereditary hemolytic anemia associated with adenosine deaminase overproduction. Analphalipoproteinemia (Tangier disease) and hypoalphalipoproteinemia are associated with stomatocytosis. 
                        <p>Increased stomatocytes have been reported in association with target cells in a single patient with familial hypobetalipoproteinemia, but in the published photograph, the target cells are much more convincing than the stomatocytes. 
                            LCAT deficiency shows both target cells and stomatocytes. An increased incidence of stomatocytosis has been reported in healthy Mediterranean (Greek and Italian) subjects in Australia. This condition, designated Mediterranean stomatocytosis/macrothrombocytopenia, is now known to be a manifestation of hereditary phytosterolemia. Similar morphological features, also associated with hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia, occur in association with parenteral nutrition with soy-based lipid emulsions.</p> </p>

                        "Teardrop" or pear-shaped cells (dacrocytes) occur when there is bone marrow fibrosis or severe dyserythropoiesis and also in some types of hemolytic anemias. They are particularly characteristic of megaloblastic anemia, thalassemia major, and myelofibrosis - either primary myelofibrosis or myelofibrosis secondary to metastatic carcinoma or other bone marrow infiltration. 
                        In both thalassemia major and primary myelofibrosis, the proportion of teardrop cells decreases following splenectomy, suggesting either that they are the product of extramedullary hematopoiesis or that they are formed when the spleen causes further damage to abnormal red cells. Teardrop cells that are present in occasional cases of autoimmune hemolytic anemia, Heinz body hemolytic anemia, and Î²-thalassemia major are likely to be the result of the action of splenic macrophages on abnormal erythrocytes, resulting in the removal of part of the red cell, Heinz bodies, or Î± chain precipitates. 
                        Teardrop poikilocytes are common in patients with erythroleukemia.</p>
